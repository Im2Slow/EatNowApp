THIS PROJECT IS ON HOLD FOR SOME TIME (OR FOREVER WHO KNOWS)

# EatNowApp

As a part of our 2nd year's project at ESILV engineering school, we plan to build an app dedicated to Android allowing our students/teachers to order food near our school's location which is : La DÃ©fense, FRANCE.

This repository has been created to list and share every sheets we made using Java on AndroidStudio, in order to build our first inferfaces. So far we have built 2 interfaces : Login Screen and First Menu.

It seems that we can't get any further without our database being online as the other interfaces will mainly require SQL requests.
